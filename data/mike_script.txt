And there is Kevin.There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. (to Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin' starts using the product, it is a spout that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you don't have to rip it open.) This works with any milk carton.Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?Oh wow! Im free for her!Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.And there is Kevin. [Cut forward.]This is the first time hes ever used this product, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. (To Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin' starts using the product, it is a spout that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you don't have to rip it open.) This works with any milk carton.Yeah?I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I    did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and    taking some risks.I am Mike.How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time    somebody has asked me that.Yeah, we met in college. (Off Joey's look) I mean, high school.Well, I'm a lawyer.Actually, I just gave up my practice.I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't    do this now, I never will.No, I didn't.'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!What?!(Joey holds up six fingers) Six!I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.It was nice meeting you!Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy.    Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd    meet a pretty girl. Which I did.My name in Mike, and I do play piano.There isn't a piano here.(Plays 'air piano')Really?That's great. What kind of music do you play?Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?Phoebe (comes in smiling then sees Phoebe crying) what's wrong?its Mike HanagenHey, so are you sure your ready to go.Sure (looks confused) who are you?Oh.Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?oh it's just you have that look (shuts the front door)what's up is Phoebe ok?that's why she was weird.I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the phone with her,    were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with you stranger from    the coffee house.hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said Phoebe's never    had a serious relationship?but you did say itVicrum?(Ross opens the door) You know I'm trying to think of the last time I    opened a door and you weren't there, Phoebe are you ok? (She has her hands over    her mouth)But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Rossthat is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.I just think there's somebody better out there for you, (pause) I mean    I'm not saying me but. maybe me.and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although I do    smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just think I can make you    happy.what's wrong?uh huhNo. well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the    truth and also wanna kiss you.DefinitelyThis is nice.You need both hands for that?Is it?Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about  someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone  like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... (He  tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... Phoebe looks  in a "what's happening" face to him. He finally has found something) No, not...  that's gum. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that  happens, you know... Think no note's there...Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what he's been looking  for. A key.)It's to my apartment.Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your  key just because...Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets her keychain from  her bag.)Is this cool, huh?Well... hey, the key works...! (he looks as if he doesn't want to  believe what's happening)So... how many guys have your key?Your lipstick's on his mouth.Did you uhm......kiss him?Don't point your finger at me.Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it... (he hits  David's finger with his finger and they start to finger-fight using their  fingers as swords saying all kinds of macho crap)Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.Well, I might.Hey, what are you kidding me?It's never gonna happen again right?Wow! You look like... like my mom.Great! Come on in! (Mike kisses her on the cheek. A butler walks in and takes Phoebe's coat.)No, my parents are rich.Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.Hey... Wh... What are you doing?Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not (accent) Phoebe...Well, come on...No, no, no, you're doing fine, really... Why don't you go talk to my dad?Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, why don't you go talk to my mom?Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding. (Mike walks away and Bitsy walks in the same direction.)Awesome!Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?(sighs) No...Stop! (The butler serves dinner)Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian.Phoebe you don't have to eat...So...? What do you think? (looks at his parents, which look in disgust)Hey, what's going on?A little better.I'm not interested.All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are...So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love...The woman I love... (he walks to Phoebe) I love you... Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've ever met in my life...You do?Wanna get out of here?Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.Bye [Shuts door]Ive got beerAhhh. Why dont we start with the beer?Yeah?Yah, do you have one here? [Ross swigs his beer]Okay [nervous laugh] [Clink each others bottle of Fosters together. Each take a swig]Ahhh. [Long, awkward silence]Yeah. [Beat] Im sorry. I dont really like to talk about it.Ross:  [Lost for words] Yeah, er thats okay. Well talk about something else. [They take another swig of beer]So, youre a palaeontologist, right?My cousins a palaeontologist.[Looks at watch] Eleven minutes. [Still looking at watch] And now  twelve. [Picks up bottle] Do you like the beer?Oh. Whats the difference between a beer and a lager?Things are about to get wild!Passst. Im gonna take off.Yeah.You mean lager.Ohh. [Relieved to be out of there]Hello? [Bar. Phoebe is on the other end of the phone. Scenes switch with the  conversation]Uh no, I just left.What? Go back? To the land where time stands still?I cant do that.Alright, Ill do it. [Phoebe sticks her thumb up to Rachel] Really,  though, how much dirtier can it get?Hey, buddy!Can I come back in?Well, [negotiating an entrance] I was just thinking of how muck more we  have to talk about.So, with the exception of the fermentation process, beer and ale are  basically the same thing. Fascinating, isnt it?Ill get it [Jumps across Ross and grabs the phone. Ross looks shocked]  Hello? Ross place, Mike speaking. [Passing phone to Ross] Its for you. [Ross takes phone]Mike: Hi! [Ross jumps up out of his seat, runs and hugs Rachel. Mike  walks up to Phoebe]So glad youre back [Hugs Phoebe]Its true, I did.Bye!No, just his mom.Yeah.Uh huh., Mike: Hi! [Ross sits down]Stout. Thats a kind of beer. [Ross gets up and leaves] [The End]Lima.You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox".    (opens the kitchen cabinet) Oh god! Oh!OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just    saw a rat in your cupboard.What, is he your pet rat?You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary,    and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have    to get rid of it!Thank you.Hey PSetting rat traps.No, no, to test his neck strength.Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.Better think of a new name for him.I don't know, I mean I'm not sure (they hear cracking voice from    somewhere else in the kitchen, probably a rat caught in a trap) ...Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.Yeah. We have rat babies now.Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve    around their rats?Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when    they mate and there are hundreds of them?Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love    the one you're with" kind of animals.Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let    the box of rats ruin our lives.It's gonna be ok.No, I think you're sweet.Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got    to get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth   singing "I touch myself"...I'm not here to judge!Well I've got a book around...All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of    "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica   singing "Delta Dawn".Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.Sure.Also a good gift? Underwear.  I'm gonna go. (He kisses Phoebe on the cheek)I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some    more clothes.I put that tube top on as a joke.I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these    boxers as I can..Done it. (Phoebe becomes a little more subdued) I'll be back in    a couple of hours.Me too. (He leaves. A few moments later, he enters again.) You    know what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.No, no! What I mean is,  I hate going back to my apartment    now... and partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because    when I'm there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?So we're doing it?Yeah!Phoebe and I are moving in together.I'm gonna go to the bathroom.Yes dear.You ready to go?What are you talking about?Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little "groomy"    joke.I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna    say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together,    you're not expecting a proposal, right?Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever    go.Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get    married again.It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind    of lost faith in the whole idea.At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first    time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married    again.I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving    in together isn't the best idea.Trust me, I will never...Very cool.No but... You don't want to get married either right?You wanna get married?But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?I want to live with you too! Let's do that!Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your    mind about marriage.No.But I don't want this to end.I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff    packed up.Ok... so...(They hug) Goodbye.Phoebe called me.Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see... Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!(to Phoebe) So how've you been?(to Phoebe) You look really beautiful.Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed    you.I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back    together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one    more night.It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the    last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize    your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time    I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.Oh, crap!My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.Hello?Who is this?(sounds shocked and sits down) He... he's gonna propose?Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.Hi David. Chandler. Monica... (Looks at Monica, checking her big hair, aghast) Oh!Hi Phoebe.I have a question I need to ask you.Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.Actually yeah, that'll be great.Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.Sorry David, but she really has to know this.We can have any future you want.Is it ok if I hug you now?(popping by, smiling) You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!Oh... I'm back! & Mike: Yeah! (they leave)They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.I'll play ya!(disbelieving) I think I will be all right! (to Monica) You wanna volley a bit for a serve?Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!You're ready to play?Wanna make it more interesting?Ten bucks a game?I'll make it a hundred!To see who goes first, you got a quarter?Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.Do you?Do you?DO YOU?(boasting) Game, point!You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.And that's how it's done! (Phoebe kisses him)That's what I'm thinking.(doing Monica and mumbling): Serve the ball, chump.Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.So you forfeit?Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.Ok!Hello?Who is this?(sounds shocked and sits down) He... he's gonna propose?Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.Hi David. Chandler. Monica... (Looks at Monica, checking her big hair, aghast) Oh!Hi Phoebe.I have a question I need to ask you.Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.Actually yeah, that'll be great.Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.Sorry David, but she really has to know this.We can have any future you want.Is it ok if I hug you now?(popping by, smiling) You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!Oh... I'm back! & Mike: Yeah! (they leave)They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.I'll play ya!(disbelieving) I think I will be all right! (to Monica) You wanna volley a bit for a serve?Oh, by the way...

(Phoebe kisses him)That's what I'm thinking.(doing Monica and mumbling): Serve the ball, chump.Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.So you forfeit?Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.Ok!You should be careful when checking your overhead bins,   'cause items may shift during...You don't have to go home tonight, do you?Oh...Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.I have a date.Oh, it's... my girlfriend.Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started   seeing someone.Three months.I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I   promise.Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the   packing material...Hey, it's Mike.Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think   I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious   on my coffee table.Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.                     Mike: I know. This                              has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering                              so he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR                              OF MY LIFE!I FEEL THE SAME                              WAY!Really?(looks strangely                              shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes                              what she did).  Great game, huh?Why do you keep                              looking at the screen?Going go to the                              bathroom.Why?But please, let's                              just forget the whole thing.(puts on a fake                              smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?                              (he takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with                              a napkin)No! It's my fault.                              I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and                              all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want                              to spend the rest of my life with you.I'm gonna do                              this now.Phoebe, I...Ready?Phoebe, I love                              you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask                              to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care                              of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you...                              Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?I love you!Not possible!                              (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna                              be Mrs. No Balls.Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar                            a year industry.Are you serious?I think it would make me wanna marry you even                            more. (he kisses her)Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.Not necessary.And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike                            Hannigan".It does. It feels really good!We’re seriously asking for our money back?Yeah! This feels really good.She could have been talking about either one                            of us.  You never told me about that guy on your sweet                            sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about                            that.Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding.                            I mean, you really deserve that.No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't                            make me go back there.Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.No, no, we're here to give the money back.(takes the check from Phoebe) Ok, look! Enough!                            Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down!                            As your future husband I'm going to make this decision                            for us. (thinking) Now... what do you think we should                            do?What?Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that                            way we can save up, come back in a few years and make                            an even bigger donation.Thanks for coming you guys.Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?Yeah.Hey guys, how is it going?Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question                            for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had                            had an emergency and can't make it....and I was wondering if... you know, maybe                            one of you guys... You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room                            for one.You know, I really don't feel very comfortable                            making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better,                            I'm gonna let her choose. (he leaves)Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.I intend to marry her.No more so than acting.You're right. She probably will support me. Hey,                            unless we move in with you, dad?Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?Is that what you say to Chandler?Hey.(thinks a moment) Orchids?Joseph.(looking around the room) This is... great...(not amused) Are you rehearsing for some really                            bad mafia movie?Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do                            you want?(gets up) Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single                            most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let                            anything happen to her. That must have been one lousy movie.Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night                            advice. (walks away) That didn't make me uncomfortable                            at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant                            ice sculpture in the hall? Hey, I forgot my scarf. Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I                            had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third                            groomsman was my family dog. Chappy. I think I wanna get married to you today. Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! (kisses                            his dad) Hi! (kisses his mom) Mom, I know getting married                            in the street isn't something you approve of...(to Chandler and Ross) You know, Chappy's too                            small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have                            to walk him down the aisle.I guess.Oh, no! My God! Aren't you freezing?Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're                            so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day                            with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky                            I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever.                            (He puts the ring on Phoebe's finger.)I love you too. I do.(raising his glass) Thank you guys for having                            us over.(walks to the couch with coffee for Phoebe) Here                            you go.Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name.                            You've got to live with it. You're a strange kind of grown-up.Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that                            right now?Hey (He kisses Phoebe)Ah! I missed youSo, what's new?That's great!
